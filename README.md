Oder the book here http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119037999.html or here www.amazon.com/Derivatives-Analytics-Python-Simulation-Calibration/dp/1119037999/.

There are two code versions available: for **Python 3.6** and **Python 2.7** (not maintained anymore).

## Python Packages

There is now a `yaml` file for the installation of required Python packages in the repository. This is to be used with the `conda` package manager (see https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). If you do not have Miniconda or Anaconda installed, we recommend to install **Miniconda 3.6** first (see https://conda.io/miniconda.html).

After you have cloned the repository, do on the **Linux/Mac** shell:

    cd dawp
    conda env create -f dawp_conda.yml
    source activate dawp
    cd python36
    jupyter notebook

On **Windows**, do:

    cd dawp
    conda env create -f dawp_conda.yml
    activate dawp
    cd python36
    jupyter notebook

Then you can navigate to the Jupyter Notebook files and get started.
